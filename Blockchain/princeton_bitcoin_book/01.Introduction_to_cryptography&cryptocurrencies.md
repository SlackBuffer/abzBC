# Introduction to cryptography cryptocurrencies
- Use cryptography to prevent tampering and equivocation, as well as to encode the rules fro creating new units of the currency into a mathematical protocol
## Cryptographic hash function
- 通用哈希函数
    1. 任何尺寸的字符串作为输入
    2. 输出固定长度的字符串（如 256-bit）
    3. Efficiently computable
        - Computing the hash of an n ‐bit string should have a running time that is `O(n)`
 - Cryptographic hash functions 额外的特性要求
    1. Collision-resistance
    2. Hiding
    3. Puzzle-friendliness
### Collision-resistance
- A collision occurs when two distinct inputs produce the same output
- A hash function `H` is said to be collision resistant if it is infeasible to find two values, `x` and `y` , such that `x ≠ y` , yet `H(x) = H(y)`
- 碰撞必定存在
- 哈希函数的输入包括任意长度的所有字符串，输出只包含固定长度的字符串，必定存在大量的多对一
    - 挑 2^256+1 个输入计算输出（共 x^256 个结果），就必定存在碰撞
    - 随机挑 2^130+1 个输入就有 99.8% 的可能性至少有 2 个会冲突
        - > The fact that we can find a collision by only examining roughly the square root of the number of possible outputs results from a phenomenon in probability known as the *birthday paradox*
- 暴力破解不可行
    - 256 位的输出，最坏情况要算 2^256+1 次，平均要算约 2^128 次
        - > If a computer calculates 10,000 hashes per second, it would take more than one octillion (10^27) years to calculate 2^128 hashes
        - > If every computer ever made by humanity was computing since the beginning of the entire universe, up to now, the odds that they would have found a collision is still infinitesimally small. So small that it’s way less than the odds that the Earth will be destroyed by a giant meteor in the next two seconds
- 因此没有通用的具有可行性的寻找碰撞的算法，但对于特定的哈希函数，则存在

    ```
    H(x) = x mod x^256
    ```

    - This function meets our requirements of a hash function as it accepts inputs of any length, returns a fixed sized output (256 bits), and is efficiently computable
    - One collision then would be the values 3 and 3 + 2^256
- There are no hash functions proven to be collision‐resistant
- The cryptographic hash functions that we rely on in practice are just functions for which people have tried really, really hard to find collisions and haven’t yet succeeded
    - In some cases, such as the old MD5 hash function, collisions were eventually found after years of work, leading the function to be deprecated and phased out of practical use
- And so we choose to believe that those are collision resistant
- Use hash outputs as a **message digest**
    - If we know that two inputs `x` and `y` to a collision‐resistant hash function `H` are different, then it’s safe to assume that their hashes `H(x) and `H(y)` are different
        - If someone knew an `x` and `y` that were different but had the same hash, that would violate our assumption that `H` is collision resistant

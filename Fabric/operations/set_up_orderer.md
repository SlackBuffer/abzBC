## Create an organization definition
- Like peers, all orderers must belong to an organization that must be created before the orderer itself is created
- This organization has a definition encapsulated by a Membership Service Provider (MSP) that is created by a Certificate Authority (CA) dedicated to creating the certificates and MSP for the organization
- Creating a CA and using it to create users and an MSP - https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html
## Configure the node
- The configuration of the orderer is handled through a `yaml` filed called `orderer.yaml`
- The `FABRIC_CFG_PATH` environment variable is used to point to an `orderer.yaml` file you’ve configured, which will extract a series of files and certificates on your file system
- `LocalMSPID` - this is the name of the MSP, generated by your CA, of your orderer organization
    - This is where your orderer organization admins will be listed
- `LocalMSPDir` — the place in your file system where the local MSP is located
- `TLS`
    - This is where you specify whether you want to enable TLS. If you set this value to `true`, you will have to specify the locations of the relevant TLS certificates
        - Note that this is mandatory for Raft nodes
- `GenesisFile` — this is the name of the genesis block you will generate for this ordering service
- `GenesisMethod` — the method by which the genesis block is created
    - This can be either `file`, in which the file in the `GenesisFile` is specified, or `provisional`, in which the profile in `GenesisProfile` is used
- If you are deploying this node as part of a cluster (for example, as part of a cluster of Raft nodes), make note of the `Cluster` and `Consensus` sections
- If you plan to deploy a Kafka based ordering service, you will need to complete the `Kafka` section
## Generate the genesis block of the orderer
- The first block of a newly created channel is known as a “genesis block”
- If this genesis block is being created as part of the creation of a new network (in other words, if the orderer being created will not be joined to an existing cluster of orderers), then this genesis block will be the first block of the “orderer system channel” (also known as the “ordering system channel”), a special channel managed by the orderer admins which includes a list of the organizations permitted to create channels
- The genesis block of the orderer system channel is special: it must be created and included in the configuration of the node before the node can be started
## Bootstrap the ordering node
- Once you have built the images, created the MSP, configured your orderer.yaml, and created the genesis block, you’re ready to start your orderer
	
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-cli.yaml up -d --no-deps orderer.example.com
    ```

    - Replace `orderer.example.com` with the address of your orderer
